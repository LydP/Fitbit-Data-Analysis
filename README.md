# Fitbit Data Analysis

## Introduction

This is my analysis of Divvy Fitbit data for the Google Data Analytics certificate capstone project. My certificate can be seen [here](https://www.credly.com/badges/6e51f2de-b45a-4e2e-bff1-3da04eff93de). This repository contains the SQBPRO file in which I wrote SQLite queries for the data, the data itself in the DB file, and my analysis and conclusions in a PDF report.

## Data
